# 📝 To-Do List App with Streamlit

This repository contains a simple To-Do List application built using Python and Streamlit. The app allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by adding, completing, and clearing tasks. Task data is stored in a CSV file to ensure persistence across sessions.

# 🚀 What is Streamlit?

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share interactive web applications for data science and machine learning projects.
	•	Streamlit allows you to build a web interface using simple Python code — no need to learn HTML, CSS, or JavaScript!
	•	It handles the frontend and backend automatically, providing real-time state updates and user interactions.

# 🏗️ How I Used Streamlit

✅ 1. Task Display
	•	Used st.write() to display tasks.
	•	Used st.checkbox() to allow users to mark tasks as completed.

✅ 2. Adding Tasks
	•	Used st.text_input() for task input.
	•	Placed the input field and button side-by-side using st.columns() for better alignment.

✅ 3. State Management
	•	Used st.session_state to store tasks.
	•	Updated state in real time and used st.experimental_rerun() to refresh the interface dynamically.

✅ 4. Persistence
	•	Used Pandas to save and load tasks from a CSV file, ensuring that tasks are saved even after the app is closed.
